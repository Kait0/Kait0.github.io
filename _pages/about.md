I am a PhD student at the university of Tübingen, where I am part of the [Autonomous Vision Group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/) led by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](http://www.cvlibs.net/).
I am part of the [International Max Plank Research School for Intelligent Systems](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/).

**Research:** I am currently interested in solving the problem of autonomous driving. My research thus lies at the intersection of computer vision, robotics and computer graphics. I am currently investigating end-to-end imitation learning and how to build realistic (self-driving) simulations.

**Biography:** I studied B.Sc. Informatics: Games Engineering at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/). 
Following that I worked for 1 year as a software developer at [FERCHAU](https://www.ferchau.com) where I developed the graphics software for a digital light technology.
Afterwards I did a M.Sc. in Computer Science at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/).
I started my PhD at the Autonomous Vision Group in April 2022.
